The Principles of Microservices


**Model Around Your Business Domain** Domain-driven design can help you find stable, reusable boundaries.

**Build a Culture of Automation** More moving parts means automation is key.

**Hide Implementation Details** One of the pitfalls that distributed systems can often fall into is tightly coupling their services together.

**Embrace Decentralization** To achieve autonomy, push power out of the center, organizationally and architecturally.

**Deploy Independently** Perhaps the most important characteristic microservices need.

**Focus on Consumers First** As the creator of an API, make your service easy to consume.

**Isolate Failure** Microservice architecture doesnâ€™t automatically make your systems more stable.

**Make Them Highly Observable** With many moving parts, understanding what is happening in your system can be challenging.
